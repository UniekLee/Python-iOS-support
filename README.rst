Python.framework
================

This is a meta-package for building a version of Python that can be embedded
into an iOS project.

It works by downloading, patching, and building a fat binary static libffi.a
and libPython.a, and packaging them both in iOS Framework format.

The binaries support the `$(ARCHS_STANDARD_32_BIT)` set - that is, armv7 and
armv7s. This should enable the code to run on iPhone 3GS, 4, 4s, 5 and 5s.

This repository builds a packaged version of **Python 2.7.6**. Other Python
versions are available by cloning other branches of the main repository.

Quickstart
----------

Download/clone this repository, and then in the root directory, run:

    $ make

This should:

1. Download the original source packages
2. Patch them as required for iOS compatibility
3. Build the packages as iOS frameworks.

The build products will be in the `build` directory. You'll need to add
**all** these frameworks (not just Python.framework) to your project.

This work draws on the groundwork provided by `Kivy's iOS packaging tools.`_

The approach to framework packaging is drawn from `Jeff Verkoeyen`_, and
`Ernesto García's`_ tutorials.
